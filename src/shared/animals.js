    desc: 'The hedgehogs that hibernate can be found burrowing in small, dry, sheltered areas safely away from their enemies. They like to keep their house under sheds, in old rabbit holes, on or under woodpiles, in compost heaps, and they enjoy living amongst the tree roots. The object is for the hedgehog to stay warm, but when they start to feel cold, they won’t mess around with building a warmer bed in their established home, they will just move out and find residency elsewhere.',

    desc: 'You will find the chipmunks digging a burrow as far as 3-feet under the ground usually directly under or next to a cover to stay protected from their predators. During their active daytime periods, later in the summer and early fall, you will often enjoy watching them as they nestle their nuts between their cheeks taking them to their burrows to save for their winter hibernation.',

    desc: 'Bears hibernate in their dens. A den can be built in hollow trees, the crevices of rocks, hillsides, under the root system of trees, caves, and even under leaves and brush. When a bear hibernates in a cave or rock crevice, it is very rare that the same bear will hibernate there again the following winter, however, another family won’t hesitate to move right in.',

Those bats choosing to stay behind usually find comfort sharing wall space in dark, quiet caves. Bats are not afraid of sharing space with humans during the cold months though. They often find comfort living near houses in hollowed trees, barns, and other outside buildings. Don’t be surprised though if they take up space in your attic, crawl spaces, or in your basement. They’re not picky as long as they have a warm, quiet, dark space to sleep.',
